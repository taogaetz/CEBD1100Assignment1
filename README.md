CEBD 1100 – Introduction to Data Analysis and Python
Assignment #1


Due date: Oct 4, 2022


Submission: On Moodle


Please Note: This is an individual assignment, and no late assignments will be accepted.
Solve the following coding questions on either a JupyterLab Notebook or your IDE of choice
and upload your solution on GitHub under the repository name, Assignment1.


# Question #1: [2]
Write an equation that uses multiplication, division, an exponent, addition, and subtraction that is
equal to 100.75.

Hint: This is just to test your memory of the basic arithmetic commands, work backwards from
100.75.


# Question #2: [2]
Given a string, return a version without the first and last character, so "Hello" yields "ell".
The string length will be at least 2.

'Hello' → 'ell'

'java' → 'av'

‘coding' → 'odin'



# Question #3: [2]
Given 2 int arrays, a and b, each length is unknown, return a new array of length 2
containing their second last elements.

[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] → [2, 5]

[7, 7], [3, 8, 0] → [7, 8]

[5, 2, 9, 0, 2, 4], [1, 4, 5, 1] → [2, 5]



# Question #4: [2]

Reassign 'hello' in this nested list to say 'goodbye' instead:

nested_list = [ 1, 2, [ 3, 4, 'hello' ] ]


# Question #5: [1]

Given a list below, find and return only the unique elements of this list.

my_list = [ 1, 2, 2, 33, 4, 411, 22, 3, 3, 2 ]


# Question #6: [2]

Write a script that opens a file name “test.txt”, writes the length of the string
“yshdbsvekldf”(should not be hardcoded) and closes the file.

Please note that you will be given a new string during the demo, so do not hard code the
length.


# Question #7: [2]

What is the boolean output of the cell block below?

l_one = [ 1, 2, [ 3, 4 ] ]

l_two = [ 1, 2, { 'k1' : 4 } ]

l_one[2][0] >= l_two[2]['k1']



# Question #8: [2]

Using keys and indexing, grab the 'hello' from the following dictionary:

d = { 'k1' : [ { 'nest_key' : [ 'this is deep' , [ 'hello' ] ] } ] }
